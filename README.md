# Hand-Tracking-Robot-arm
This robot arm is based on the ATmega328P microcontroller and is part of an embedded system project. The robot arm detects hand movements using your webcam and has 5 degrees of freedom (DOF), though it can be developed for more DOF. Hand tracking is performed using the Google MediaPipe Python library, and the robot arm's movements are controlled by 3 SG90 servos and 2 MG996R servos.
